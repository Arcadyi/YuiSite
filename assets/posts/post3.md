How does it feel to be taken care of?
Will I ever know?

Maybe I want to be dealt with. I want to be the one you cannot ignore. You cannot simply erase me from your memory. Take me seriously. Feel the same pain you inflicted. Do not run away. Do not turn your gaze away from me.

Do not pretend I have not taken years of your life.

The longer you rub it clean, the more the bloodstain smears.
